## My Task

I created a password generator which is capable to create a password compsed by 4 types of letters(numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase), the length of password is between  8 to 128 units.


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

```
